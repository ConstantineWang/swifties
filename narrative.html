This shift to a more popular and mainstream music genre, characterized by shorter, catchier songs, and universal themes, attracted a wider audience and obtained more streams. The data illustrates a clear trend in Taylor Swift's album popularity over time, with the line graph displaying a substantial increase in popularity following the release of her 2014 album "1989”. This data trend suggests that her move to a more mainstream and popular music genre had a positive impact on her album's appeal, leading to an increase in the frequency of streams and ultimately the album’s success. With indie pop “folklore” having the highest popularity score, followed by pop albums “reputation” and “Lover,” we can infer that pop music tends to receive more attention on mainstream radio, streaming platforms, and music charts, leading to higher streaming numbers and popularity.
