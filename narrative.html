            <h1>Understanding Gen Z:</h1>
        
            <ol style="font-size: 20px;">
                <li>
                    <strong>Digital Natives:</strong> Gen Z has grown up in an internet-saturated world. They are accustomed to having a world of information and entertainment at their fingertips. Swift's active online presence and utilization of platforms like Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok helps her to engage with this demographic.<sup>1</sup>
                </li>
        
                <br>
        
                <li>
                    <strong>Value Authenticity:</strong> As you mentioned, Gen Z values authenticity, and Swift's open narratives about her personal life and feelings in her music reflect this. Her candid approach in addressing feuds, friendships, love, and other experiences through her songs appeals to a generation that dismisses pretense.<sup>2</sup>
                </li>
        
                <br>
        
                <li>
                    <strong>Social and Political Awareness:</strong> Gen Z is more socially and politically aware, often advocating for causes they believe in. Swift's shift in the recent years towards political activism, such as her stance on LGBTQ rights and her criticism of certain politicians, aligns with the values of this generation.<sup>3</sup>
                </li>
        
                <br>
        
                <li>
                    <strong>Nostalgia and Connection to the Past:</strong> Gen Z, despite being digital natives, have a peculiar penchant for the past. They often romanticize eras they never lived in. Swift's ability to capture past eras in her music videos and her references to past relationships provides the nostalgic element they crave.<sup>4</sup>
                </li>
        
                <br>
        
                <li>
                    <strong>Emphasis on Mental Health:</strong> Gen Z has been more open about discussing mental health compared to previous generations. Swift’s music, which touches upon vulnerabilities, insecurities, and personal growth, finds a sympathetic ear in this generation.<sup>6</sup>
                </li>
            </ol>
        
            <p>To sum up, the confluence of Taylor Swift's evolving artistry, advocacy, and personal narratives deeply aligns with the characteristics, values, and preferences of Gen Z. Her music and image serve as a mirror, reflecting the ethos of this generation. The synergy between Swift and Gen Z is a testament to her timeless appeal and her understanding of the zeitgeist of contemporary youth culture. So let's take a look at Gen Z.</p>

                <div style="width:40%; ">
                    <p>The line graph shows that Taylor Swift's albums have become increasingly popular over time, with a significant jump in popularity after her 2014 album, 1989. This album was her first full-fledged pop album, and it marked a major departure from her earlier country music sound.
                    </p>
                    <p>There are a few reasons why this genre shift may have led to increased popularity. First, pop music is simply more popular than country music in general. In the United States, pop music accounts for the majority of radio airplay and album sales. This means that Taylor Swift's music was more likely to be heard by a wider audience when she switched to pop.</p>
                    <p>Second, Taylor Swift's pop music is more accessible than her country music. Her pop songs are typically shorter and have more catchy melodies. This makes them easier to listen to and remember, which can lead to more streams.
                        </p>
                    <p>Finally, Taylor Swift's pop music is more relatable to a wider audience. Her songs often deal with universal themes like love, heartbreak, and friendship. This makes them more appealing to people of all ages and backgrounds.</p>    
                    </p>

            <div id="bio">
                <p>Of course, there are other factors that have contributed to Taylor Swift's popularity, such as her strong songwriting skills and her savvy marketing campaigns. However, her genre shift from country to pop was a major turning point in her career, and it helped to propel her to superstardom. Overall, the evidence suggests that Taylor Swift's genre shift from country to pop was a major factor in her increased popularity. Her pop music is more accessible, relatable, and popular than her country music, which has helped her to reach a wider audience.

                    </p>
                    <p >The evolution of Taylor Swift's albums, starting with Taylor Swift, Fearless, and Speak Now, transitioning to Red, and eventually to 1989, showcases her desire to break free from the confines of gender restrictions within the country music genre. Analyzing the bar chart reveals a clear upward trend in popularity from the album Taylor Swift to Red, indicating her successful transition from country to pop music. Notably, albums with a pop music direction exhibit higher popularity compared to those firmly rooted in country music.
                        The re-recorded version of Fearless (Platinum Edition 2008 and Taylor's Version 2021) serves as a remarkable example of her growth and maturity, exemplified by the alterations in lyrics and musical style. This transformation over a span of 13 years also reflects her evolving perspective, which aligns with feminist themes. To gain comprehensive insights into the development of Taylor's music and its societal and cultural impact, it is imperative to thoroughly examine both primary and secondary sources.

                        <p>As per Spotify's metrics, the valence score, ranging from 0.0 to 1.0, indicates the degree of musical positiveness in a track. Higher valence scores represent more positive emotions such as happiness, cheerfulness, and euphoria, while lower scores suggest negative emotions like sadness, depression, or anger. On the other hand, the energy score, also ranging from 0.0 to 1.0, measures the intensity and activity perceived in a track.
                    </p>
                    <p>Analyzing the graph, it becomes evident that a significant portion of Taylor Swift's songs, as analyzed, have a low valence score, implying that they contain negative commentary on her past loves or relationships. However, in contrast, the average energy score is relatively high, indicating a sense of intensity and activity in her music.
                        </p>
                    <p>This intriguing contrast between the predominantly low valence scores and the comparatively high energy scores in Taylor Swift's songs prompts us to delve deeper into both primary and secondary sources. Understanding the inner needs and emotions of Generation Z, the target audience of Taylor Swift's music, can shed light on the reasons behind this musical pattern and its impact on her listeners. Therefore, a comprehensive examination of various sources will aid in unraveling the complexities of Taylor Swift's artistic choices and the way they resonate with her audience.

                    </p>
                    <p>Our one assumption to check a Gen Z’s listening habit is that does the duration of a music affects a popularity score since there is a study that demonstrates Gen Z is destroying three-minute pop track. 
                        </p>
                    <p>

Since there is no linear relationship is shown, so it is hard to say there is a clear correlation between track duration and its popularity. We are only using Taylor Swift’s tracks and this dataset reflects all Spotify users, so it does not aim to Gen Z only. However, our thesis can be expanded to future research if we can secure a Gen Z’s listening data.

                    <p>This is a bar graph of the average energy score divided by release year, with each bar representing a different year. The color is weighted by the average popularity. The darker the color, the more popular it is, and the lighter the color, the less popular it is.

                        Energy is a measure of intensity and activity on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0. Tracks with high energy tend to be fast, loud, and noisy.                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Popularity is a measure of how popular a song is among Spotify users, on a scale of 0 to 100.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The reason we included this as a research question is because we thought that the mood of the song somehow reflects the social atmosphere. As the graph shows, the average energy level in the 2020s is lower than in the 2010s overall, and I think this kind of tendency would reflect the worldwide effect, the COVID-19 pandemic for example.
                    </p>
                    <p >
                        The COVID-19 pandemic may have affected the energy levels of songs, including Taylor Swift's. The pandemic changed the way artists create music, and they may have chosen to create more quiet or introspective music in response to the challenging circumstances. In addition, the pandemic was a significant event that could affect the mood or energy of their songs.

                    To investigate whether Taylor Swift's music was specifically affected by the pandemic or any other significant social change, we could compare the energy levels of her songs released before and after the social change. But we should note that such an analysis could only show correlation, not cause and effect. Even if her songs had lower energy levels during the pandemic than before, this does not guarantee that this tendency was caused the pandemic. Her personal experiences or creative decisions unrelated to the pandemic could also have played a role.

                <p data-aos="fade-up">
                    Nevertheless, the popularity seems to have increased over the years. From 2017 to 2023, the popularity score becomes larger, so we can expect that her social influence would have an impact on listeners.

                <p data-aos="fade-up">
                    Therefore, we can further explore the social impact of Taylor Switft using outside resources. Our team is currently working on how we can relate that into her popularity or social impact on the public. We can also observe any connection between socio-economic background and Taylor Swift's albums or tracks among her audience.

                    We created this map using Tableau to visualize the geographic information of Taylor Swift's total plays on YouTube in the top 100 countries. I found this data on https://charts.youtube.com/ since the dataset we are currently using has no geographic information, so I extracted viewership data on YouTube. The reason why I choose this type of map is that it effectively conveys the relative popularity of Taylor Swift’s music in different countries, by differentiating the size of the circle for each country.

                    This map does not seem to be directly related to our research question, but I think it somehow helps to understand the relationship between musicological features and the music consumption habits of Gen Z in the way that this map provides a broader context for understanding where and potentially how Gen Z consumes Taylor Swift’s music. In addition, we can take the argument that the lyrics of Taylor Swift's song since the map shows her music has been streamed many times even in the non-English-speaking countries. The significance of this map for our project focuses on our interest in musicological features in listening patterns. It also implies that the global audience for popular music, and the potential variations in music consumption habits and emotional responses across different cultural contexts. Ultimately, this map will help us provide a more nuanced answer to our research question.

By integrating these insights into our analysis, we can offer a more comprehensive understanding of how Gen Z's emotional experiences and the musicological features of songs interact to shape their listening habits.

                 <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="center-bottom" data-aos-duration="2000">
                     Taylor Swift's transition from country to pop music with her album "1989," led to a significant boost in her popularity. This shift to a more popular and mainstream music genre, characterized by shorter, catchier songs, and universal themes, attracted a wider audience and obtained more streams (Erich, 2023). The data illustrates a clear trend in Taylor Swift's album popularity over time, with the line graph displaying a substantial increase in popularity following the release of her 2014 album "1989”. This data trend suggests that her move to a more mainstream and popular music genre had a positive impact on her album's appeal, leading to an increase in the frequency of streams and ultimately the album’s success. With indie pop “folklore” having the highest popularity score, followed by pop albums “reputation” and “Lover,” we can infer that pop music tends to receive more attention on mainstream radio, streaming platforms, and music charts, leading to higher streaming numbers and popularity.

                    Taylor Swift's lyrics often delve into personal experiences, relationships, and emotions. Her storytelling style makes listeners feel connected to the stories she shares, allowing them to experience a deep emotional relationship with her music. The analysis of Spotify metrics offers insights into the emotional and musical characteristics of Taylor Swift's songs. The contrast between low valence scores (negative emotions) and high energy scores suggests that Taylor Swift's music often combines emotionally charged themes with higher musical energy. Gen Z’s emotional landscape indicates Gen Z’s special inclination for music that reflects the emotions and feelings commonly experienced by their generation. With Taylor Swift’s music resonating with Gen Z’s emotional depth and range, we identified key themes in albums with higher popularity scores in various valence and energy levels:

                <h2>Global Context:</h2>
                <h3>Global Music Consumption and the Impact of Global Circumstances on Streaming</h3>
                <p>
                    The map displaying Taylor Swift's YouTube plays globally underscores her cross-cultural appeal and the relatability of her music's themes and emotions across diverse societies. This widespread presence visually reinforces the concept that her music possesses an emotional resonance transcending language barriers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For Gen Z, known for their digital interconnectedness, cultural boundaries blur (Hammond, 2022). Access to global music fosters an appreciation for artists with international recognition. This generation's exposure to varied cultures and genres likely primes them to embrace music beyond linguistic confines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, Gen Z's emphasis on authenticity and relatability is evident in Taylor Swift's music, resonating universally. Taylor Swift's extensive plays worldwide reflect shared emotional threads amid diverse cultures (Zhou, 2019). This alignment with Gen Z's preference for genuine and emotionally impactful content is conspicuous.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The graph plotting song energy levels over time hints at a link between major events (e.g., COVID-19) and shifts in music consumption. While not definitive, it implies events' influence on artists' choices and music's reception. The graph also suggests Gen Z's adaptability to global mood shifts. The drop in energy levels during the 2020s, likely tied to the pandemic, underscores Gen Z's inclination to seek music mirroring their emotions and global context.

                    Essentially, our research highlights how various factors contribute to Taylor Swift's popularity among Gen Z and the Eras Tour phenomenon. The genre shifts, emotional resonance, musicological features, global consumption patterns, and societal influences explain Swift’s 17-year-long appeal, cultural significance and reasons behind the continuing records that the Eras Tour is breaking.
