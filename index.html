            You've likely heard of Taylor Swift's groundbreaking Eras Tour that is happening at the moment, which began in May 2023 and currently with the plan of 52 shows in 20 major US cities including international stops.

        <p data-aos="fade-up">
            Taylor Swift holds the title of the female artist with the most Number 1 albums, and also the first woman in history to have four of her albums in the Top 10 and has also become the first woman in history to have four albums in the Billboard Top 10 at the same time. When Taylor Swift dropped her album Red (Taylor’s Version) on 12 November 2021, Swift broke not one but two Spotify records in one day. Red (Taylor’s Version) is a re-recording of her 2012 album Red with the purpose of retaining ownership rights over her artistic works that she lost from a business deal with her former record label. Her album had more than 90 million streams on the day of its release, and the fact that it is an album that she recorded ten years ago to leave a remarkable impact reflects her influence in pop culture and Gen Z music consumption habits. Furthermore, on October 21st, 2022, her album Midnights became the most-streamed album in a single day in Spotify history, breaking the record for the most-streamed artist in a single day on Spotify. With such records, it is no doubt that Taylor Swift is the artist of the decade.
